# ext4layouttest

A small program written 2 years ago....

Just to test the layout of ext4 filesystem and help me get familiar with ext4. To avoid those VFS things and focus on ext4 itself, I use an image file. Only blocks are listed in the program as an illustration, but more can be listed depending on the needs.

Reference can be found in [ext4 wiki: ext4 on-disk layout](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout)
